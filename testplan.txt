Testing Procedure

1. First to setup the project we need to make 3 directories, two for two different clients and one 
for the server.
2. Next we need to start up the server on a seperate thread so that it can keep running without
interfering with the system calls from the clients
3. Then we use <configure> to setup both clients to work with the localhost because the server will 
be running on the same machine so that is where traffic will be sent. at port 20202
4. Then we test the <create> function by creating a "testDirectory" on both the client1 and server
5. Then we test the <add> function by adding two files to the manifest to be tracked
6. Next we test the <commit> and <push> commands by commiting the added files then pushing the
added files to the server
7. Then we test <add> with subdirectories by first making a couple of directories and then adding
a couple of files, these adds are also <commit> and <pushed>
8. To test <checkout> we change to our client2 and checkout the project from the server
9. Next we modify a couple of the files from client 1 and <commit> and <push> to make the changes
on the server
10. Changing back to client 2, we <update> and <upgrade> to retrieve the latest version of the 
files on the server.
11. Then we <remove> a file from being tracked in client 2, and <commit> and <push> that so that
server can remove it from its repository
12. Changing back to client 1, we <update> and <upgrade> to retrieve the latest version of the 
files on the server.
13. To check the history thus far, we call the <history>
14. To check the <rollback>, we roll the server back to version 1 when we had added only two files
15. We then <update> and <upgrade> the client 1 repository to reflect the deleted files.
16. Lastly we <destroy> the repository from the server.
