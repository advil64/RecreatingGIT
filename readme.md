# Recreating GIT AsstLast
This is the last assignment in CS 214 for the spring semester of 2020. Git is a a popular current iteration of a series of version control systems. Most large, complex software projects are coded using version control. Version control can be very helpful when working on a single set of source code that multiple people are contributing to by making sure that everyone is working on the same version of the code. If people are working on code in physically separate locations, it is entirely possible that two different people have edited the same original code in two ways that are incompatible with each other. A versioning control system would not allow two different versions of the same file to exist in its central repository, enforcing that any changes made to a file are seen by everyone before they can submit additional changes to the repository.
